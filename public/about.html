  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p id="bpara">
    My name is Dani. I've been in my current role for 17 years now, I've worked
    here since I was 16 - you do the maths. I decided to branch out into coding
    because it's an area I'm confident in and want to explore more.
  </p>

  <p>
    I love gaming - I stream my content on Twitch with Baldurs Gate 3, Elden
    Ring, Disney Dreamlight Valley, Dragon Age Veilguard & more recently,
    Infinity Nikki which I am obsessed with at the moment. I really love talking
    to people and building a community, that's my main reason for streaming (and
    because I'm a talky gamer)
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to know more about me and my content, come to my twitch! I'd
    love to have you. Click on my name to give me a follow or just pop in for a
